When the LPG gas leaks and it reaches 200ppm the exhaust fan will turn on and cylinder valve is closed
and at 300ppm blower fan is turned on which cause  positive air displacement ,
at 400ppm inert gas will be produced to lower the flammability of LPG. 

A mobile application is developed which acts as a bridge between the user and the micro controller.
The desired outputs and results are displayed and notified to the user through this mobile application.  
The outputs received from the WiFi module are stored.The app will indicate the concentration of leaked LPG gas and depending on the concentration, control measures are initiated.


Developed a system which can detect the LPG gas leakage and provide preventive measures according to the concentration of the gas leakage and simultaneously measure 
the level of the gas and automatically book for the new cylinder.A cylinder is to be placed on the top of the load cell. This continuously monitors the weight of the cylinder. 
The gas sensor has high sensitivity and is more sensitive to LPG.A gas Leakage is detected when the leakage value of the gas goes beyond 200ppm. If LPG leakage is detected, 
it alerts the user through a mobile application and according to the level of LPG gas leak three levels of control measures are taken. The weight value is set once the weight of the cylinder is more than 3 Kg.
